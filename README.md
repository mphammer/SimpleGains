# Simple Gains!

The idea is simple:

Let's assume you are getting enough rest and protein, your training properly, etc..

Then... 
if you want to gain muscle and your weight isn't going up then you need to eat more.

If you want to lost muscle and your weight isn't going down then you need to eat less.

## Quick Start

1. Run the _setup.py script (You will need to enter age, weight, height, body fat percentage, and estimated hours of weekly exercise)
2. Open weight_log.txt and replace the first line with the date, your weight, and your age (this is the file you will update weekly)
3. Run the _main.py script
4. Open the results.md markdown file and view your results
5. Every week add entries to weight_log.txt and adjust your caloric intake accordingly
